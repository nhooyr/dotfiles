# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Quickstart

```fish
make ensure
```

Will perform automated setup for git, nvim, fish, mutagen, fd, gpg and green.

Running just `make` will also format everything which requires prettier, fish_indent and shfmt.

btt, goland, and terminal.app settings must be imported manually.
