# dotfiles

[![CI Status](https://github.com/nhooyr/dotfiles/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhooyr/dotfiles/actions)

```fish
make ensure
```

Will perform automated setup for git, nvim, fish, mutagen, fd, gpg and green.

Running just `make` will also format everything which requires prettier, fish_indent and shfmt.

btt, goland, and terminal.app settings must be imported manually.
